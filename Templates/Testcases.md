# Definition:
Test cases are detailed instructions or scenarios that define the conditions and steps to be executed to verify whether a software application, system, or feature functions correctly. They serve as a blueprint for the testing team, guiding them through the process of validating that the software meets its specified requirements and behaves as expected. Test cases encompass input data, expected outcomes, and the specific steps to be taken during testing.
