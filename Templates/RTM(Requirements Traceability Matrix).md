# Definition:
A Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) is a document used in software development and testing that establishes a traceable link between requirements and various elements of the project, such as design, implementation, testing, and verification.
The primary purpose of an RTM is to ensure that all requirements are met through the different stages of the development process. 
It helps track the progress of each requirement from its inception to its implementation and testing, ensuring comprehensive coverage and validation.
